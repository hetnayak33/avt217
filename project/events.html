      <h3>Heritage India Festival</h3>
      <p>Since 2001, Rushhi Entertainment's multiple award-winning Heritage India Festival series has featured the best of South Asia – highlighting the culture, cuisine and shopping of South Asia. The festival, held twice a year, draws thousands of South Asian Americans to experience and revel in the colors of the subcontinent, all at a convenient and easily-accessible location.</p>

      <p>This year, the Diwali Special festival in Chantilly, VA features over 285 booths of the best that South Asia has to offer, with both local and national vendors! The festival is the perfect place to shop for apparel, jewelry, arts, handicrafts and gifts, sampling South Asian delicacies from the DC area's top restaurants and spending the weekend reconnecting with friends and family and getting ready for the holiday season.</p>
